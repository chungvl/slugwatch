        <h1>{{APP_NAME}}</h1>

        <p>
            {{APP_NAME}} was developed in 2018 by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH)
            for the collection of koala observation and survey data.
        </p>

        <p>
            All data submitted via this app is made available by OEH though BioNet, NSW’s corporate biodiversity data
            repository. BioNet data is accessible to researchers, land managers, government agencies and the public via
            the <a href="https://www.bionet.nsw.gov.au">BioNet website</a>
            and the
            <a href="https://www.seed.nsw.gov.au/">OEH SEED portal</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Koala data helps inform environmental managers, land managers and
            the community about koala numbers, distribution and habitat, and
            assists the implementation of long term conservation strategies
            to secure healthy koala populations in the wild.
        </p>
