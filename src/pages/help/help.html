        <p>
            To get started, go to the ‘Records’ screen and choose from the buttons
            below to record an observation or start a census (koala survey).  An
            observation is a one-off recording of a koala sighting at a particular
            location. A census is a systematic survey that is generally conducted at a
            defined survey site.  The census method recorded by this app is Scats Around
            Trees (SAT).  ‘Trees surveyed’ are always part of the census survey and record
            the trees that have been identified as part of the survey site.

        <p>
            Once you have recorded your data, a list of the records will be displayed here.
            You can also switch to see the records displayed on a map view using the tab buttons above.
            Click on a record in the list to continue editing that record.

        <h2>
            Uploading Records
        </h2>
        <p>
            When one or more records have been completed, you can upload them to the server by clicking the upload
            button. Completed records (shown in green) are those where all required fields are entered and within
            the allowable constraints. You can still upload completed records even if some are incomplete
            (shown in blue). Incomplete records will not be uploaded.
        </p>

        </button>

        <h1>Tree surveys</h1>
        <p>
            When working on a census, you can create one or more tree sightings. Select the <strong>Tree surveys list
            </strong> tab at the top of the page and use the button below to create a new tree sighting.
        </p>

        </button>
        <h2>GPS accuracy</h2>
        <p>
            The accuracy of the GPS in your device will improve over time after it
            has been started as it picks up signals from more satellites. You may wish to
            update the location information in your observation or census periodically if the current accuracy is
            insufficient. This can be done by pressing the "{{UPDATE_BUTTON_NAME}}" button within a record form.
